A line is a one-dimensional figure, which has length but no width. A line is made of a set of points which is extended in opposite directions infinitely. It is determined by two points in a two-dimensional plane. The two points which lie on the same line are said to be collinear points  hfjfjfj jvjkfjfj jfjfjfjfj.
